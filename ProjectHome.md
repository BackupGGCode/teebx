**TeeBX** wants to be a lightweight appliance with a graphical user interface to manage and configure a VoIP communication platform based on Asterisk(R).
To achieve this result, TeeBX started from the good work done by the askoziaPBX(R) and m0n0wall teams.

I just said that askoziaPBX is good enough, so why starting a fork?
First license issues, #2 different goals. Let's see here WhyThisFork.

Looking for code? Some a this time, you can get an idea here LookingForCode and/or tapping the source tab.
